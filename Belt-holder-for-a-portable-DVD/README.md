Description
--------
A replacement part for broken handles of a portable DVD player<br />
<br />
The history:   In 8 hours I was going to leave Madrid for having holidays with my family... Suddenly I discovered that the handles of the portable DVD player were broken...  I had to drive my car for more than 6 hours... with 2 kids  (2 and 4 years old) and without the DVD! It was going to be terrible!!!  What to do?<br />
<br />
I designed a belt holder in openscad in 20 minutes. Then I printed it on my Prusa I2 and finally I glued the parts to the DVD.  Fixed! Problem solved!  Thanks prusa! Thanks Reprap!  <br />
<br />
  The trip was so nice and calm.. :-)

Instructions
--------
* Print 2 copies of the belt-holder<br />
* Glue them to the back of the DVD player<br />
* Attach the belts<br />
* Enjoy the trip<br />
