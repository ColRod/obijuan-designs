Description
--------
It is a proof of concept of a kind of printable spring. Initially I designed it for using in my Prusa Mendel, because the z axis springs were very difficult to find for me.  Then I generalized the idea and parameterized the spring.<br />
<br />
These springs conceptually consist of a strip of plastic that is bended. The outer cross section of the spring can be square, hexagonal or octogonal.<br />
<br />
The spring parameters are:<br />
* fid (fold inner diameter)<br />
* folds: Number of folds<br />
* th: strip thickness<br />
* Drill: Drill diameter<br />
* Diameter of the outer cross section<br />
<br />
Here there is a video of the proof of concept:<br />

Instructions
--------
1.- Download the spring.scad file. Change the spring parameters and generate the STL<br />
2.- Optionally you can just print the 3 springs given as examples<br />
3.- I have used slic3r for slicing it. If the spring is small, it is quite difficult to print it.  The easier springs to print are the ones with a square cross section.<br />
4.- Print it!<br />
5.- Before using it I had to file and clean the spring
