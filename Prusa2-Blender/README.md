Description
--------
The Prusa iteration 2 modelled in Blender 2.5. All the STLs parts of the official Prusa 2 have been imported into Blender. All the vitamins have been designed in OpenScad, exported to STL and imported into Blender.<br />
<br />
This model is very useful for generating documentation. The users can explore the design to see how the different parts are attached. In addition, animations can be generated in Blender.<br />
<br />
Blender is a multi-platform open-source high-quality application. Although it has not been explicitly designed for Engineering, is rather easy to import STLs parts and create complex 3D models.<br />
