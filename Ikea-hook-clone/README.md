Description
--------
My wife wanted me to buy more Ikea hooks for the kitchen... As I am too lazy I decided to design the hook in openscad and print some of them!<br />
<br />
  As a bonus, I designed a parameterized Ikea hook so that the diameter, length, width and height can be easily changed

Instructions
--------
Just print as many as you want!!!
